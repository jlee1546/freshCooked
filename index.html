          <h2>What this is all about!</h2>
          <p>Do you get as excited as I do when you here, "fresh cooked chicken wings?" Well, that is what this site is all
            about. I decided to create a website where us "fresh wing lovers" could come together and share tips and information
            all centered around finding the freshest wings in the area.</p>      
          <p>Nowadays, companies only care about profit and serving as many wings as possible. In order to speed up the process, 
            many places "par cook" their wings. Par cooking is a process by which the wings are cooked a first time to almost complete 
            doneness. Then, the are refrigerated and held cold until ready to be cooked. A customer orders wings and gets them pretty 
            fast.</p>
